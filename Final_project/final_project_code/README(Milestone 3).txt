In CellVolume file folder, 
we have our parallel code in CellVolume/kernel.cu
our image data is stored in CellVolume/csv

Currently, we run our parallel code by using BFS method on one x-y plane.

After opening project, Click "Local Windows Debugger" to run the code.

As expected, the output will be 
161974
The volume of the cell: 198.458649 fL
